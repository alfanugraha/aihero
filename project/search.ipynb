The institution manages a large fossil collection, mainly from Upper Jurassic. One of the key issues in paleontological management is to assess spatial context of the sites from where the fossils are retrieved -- hundreds of sites representing thousands of different specimens.\\n\\n## The Project\\n\\n![](../images/portugal_torres1.jpg)\\n\\nBack in 2008, we came up with the idea of exploring GIS technologies to support the investigation and get a more holistic perspective on the heritage we were dealing. This idea boosted SIGAP Project (GIS applied to paleontology) \\\\[2\\\\]. The project, supported by public and private entities -- mainly the Municipalty, Digiterra.hu and the Army\\\\\\'s Geographic Institute (IGeoE), aimed three goals:\\n\\n-   Field Survey with Differencial GPS to gather the coordinates of the sites;\\n-   Build a Risk Model to identify hazards towards paleontological heritage and thus prevent them through regular field surveys;\\n-   Build a Geographic Database to handle all the information and start the collection inventory.\\n\\n## Software we used\\n\\nQGIS was the mainframe of all the project. Data was dumped directly to QGIS, and then edited and manipulated in order to achieve the desired outputs. The GRASS interface provided by QGIS allowed us to conduct complex spatial analyis on rasters in order to obtain the risk model we needed to plan our field work and future prospection. Furthermore it allowed us to import PostGIS layers and visualize them on QGIS.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\"../images/portugal_torres2.jpg\" class=\"align-right\" alt=\"portugal_torres2.jpg',\n",

The model shown above successfully automates the snow classification process, and delivers a GIS dataset that can be used for visualisation and input into further statistical applications. It successfully removes subjective user error associated with previous methods used by SHL, while providing a repeatable and consistent classification tool. Some seasonal results can be viewed here.\\n\\n### Author\\n\\nAndrew Jeffrey is a GIS Analyst with Snowy Hydro Limited based in Cooma NSW, Australia.

It can however misclassify portions of large water bodies as snow, caused by water having absorption characteristics in the Near Infrared part of the spectrum. This characteristic of the NDSI indicates the need to incorporate a water mask at some stage in the model.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\"../images/australia_snowyhydro2.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" width=\"300\" alt=\"australia_snowyhydro2.jpg\" />\\n<figcaption>Map 1.2 - MODIS true colour</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\"../images/australia_snowyhydro3.jpg\" class=\"align-center\" width=\"300\" alt=\"australia_snowyhydro3.jpg\" />\\n<figcaption>Map 1.3 - NDSI output</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\"../images/australia_snowyhydro4.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" width=\"300\" alt=\"australia_snowyhydro4.jpg\" />\\n<figcaption>Map 1.4 - Recoded \"Snow\" vs \"Non snow\"</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe NDSI output is created with some very simple band map by using the GRASS module \\\\\"r.mapcalculator\\\\\". Once the NDSI grid was available the NDSI threshold of 0.4 needed to be applied and this would result in a boolean grid depicting \\\\\"Snow\\\\\" and \\\\\"Non snow\\\\\" areas. To get that classification another GRASS module \\\\\"r.recode\\\\\" was used and produced the result shown above in Map 1.4 Recoded \\'Snow\\' vs \\'Non Snow\\'.\\n\\nThe recoded grid was then converted to a vector polygon dataset and the snow covered areas were extracted (shown below, Map 1.5 - Extracted snow). The snow covered areas were then clipped to the Snowy Water Catchment (shown below, Map - 1.6 Snow inside the SWC), then the large water bodies are masked out (shown below, Map 1.7 - Final snow covered area), and finally the area statistics for the snow covered area is generated.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\"../images/australia_snowyhydro5.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" width=\"300\" alt=\"australia_snowyhydro5.jpg\" />\\n<figcaption>Map 1.5 - Extracted Snow</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\"../images/australia_snowyhy',\n",

To complete this task, we created scripts that performs this operation storing results in local SpatiaLite database. The data needed to be exportable to spreadsheet, so we used free software library to fulfil this requirement.\\n\\n## How users used tool to create FTTH/GPON network plan\\n\\nThe user started work by opening a new work context and specifying an input layer of address points to be analysed. Using the standard QGIS interface, the user could establish a set of demands on address points and finally provide the parameters necessary for further steps of the algorithm.\\n\\n![](../images/poland_ffth/step1_inputlayer.png)\\n\\nWithout having information about the existing civil infrastructure, a properly filtered OpenStreet road network were used as a routing layer. Scipy algorithms fed with input parameters, clustered the address points into demand aggregates marking them with separate colour indicating its assignment to particular cluster.\\n\\n![](../images/poland_ffth/step1.png)\\n\\nHaving all address points clustered, user initiated the steps of high level network planning providing layers prepared in the previous steps and a layer with GPON network starting point.\\n\\n![](../images/poland_ffth/step1-2_result.png)\\n\\nUpon the completion of the algorithm, in QGIS there are geometry objects representing planned cables and splice closure locations. Basing on demand data and network topology, an additional information is stored in database such as the length of the cable, its profile, node's serving areas.\\n\\n![](../images/poland_ffth/step4_results.png)\\n\\nAt\",\n",

Until now, loading (and tessellation) would freeze the GUI completely - this could take many seconds depending on the complexity of input data.\\n\\nThe basic vector layer renderer and rule-based renderer were converted to use QgsChunkedEntity which is already used for terrain rendering. There are two more improvements in addition to unlocking of GUI:\\n\\n-   loading process is multi-threaded instead of using just a single core\\n-   loading is done in tiles - so it is possible to see the tiles with 3D data appearing while other data are still being loaded\\n\\nThere is a new configuration option in the 3D tab of vector layers - it determines how deep the quadtree will be. For example, one zoom level means there will be a single tile for the whole layer. Three zoom levels means there will be 16 tiles at the leaf level (every extra zoom level multiplies that by 4, so I have limited GUI to max. 8 levels which gives \\\\~16K tiles which is already a lot).\\n\\nHow a vector layer\\\\'s tiling quadtree gets p\",\n",

The institution manages a large fossil collection, mainly from Upper Jurassic. One of the key issues in paleontological management is to assess spatial context of the sites from where the fossils are retrieved -- hundreds of sites representing thousands of different specimens.\\n\\n## The Project\\n\\n![](../images/portugal_torres1.jpg)\\n\\nBack in 2008, we came up with the idea of exploring GIS technologies to support the investigation and get a more holistic perspective on the heritage we were dealing. This idea boosted SIGAP Project (GIS applied to paleontology) \\\\[2\\\\]. The project, supported by public and private entities -- mainly the Municipalty, Digiterra.hu and the Army\\\\\\'s Geographic Institute (IGeoE), aimed three goals:\\n\\n-   Field Survey with Differencial GPS to gather the coordinates of the sites;\\n-   Build a Risk Model to identify hazards towards paleontological heritage and thus prevent them through regular field surveys;\\n-   Build a Geographic Database to handle all the information and start the collection inventory.\\n\\n## Software we used\\n\\nQGIS was the mainframe of all the project. Data was dumped directly to QGIS, and then edited and manipulated in order to achieve the desired outputs. The GRASS interface provided by QGIS allowed us to conduct complex spatial analyis on rasters in order to obtain the risk model we needed to plan our field work and future prospection. Furthermore it allowed us to import PostGIS layers and visualize them on QGIS.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\"../images/portugal_torres2.jpg\" class=\"align-right\" alt=\"portugal_torres2.jpg',\n",

The model shown above successfully automates the snow classification process, and delivers a GIS dataset that can be used for visualisation and input into further statistical applications. It successfully removes subjective user error associated with previous methods used by SHL, while providing a repeatable and consistent classification tool. Some seasonal results can be viewed here.\\n\\n### Author\\n\\nAndrew Jeffrey is a GIS Analyst with Snowy Hydro Limited based in Cooma NSW, Australia.

It can however misclassify portions of large water bodies as snow, caused by water having absorption characteristics in the Near Infrared part of the spectrum. This characteristic of the NDSI indicates the need to incorporate a water mask at some stage in the model.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\"../images/australia_snowyhydro2.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" width=\"300\" alt=\"australia_snowyhydro2.jpg\" />\\n<figcaption>Map 1.2 - MODIS true colour</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\"../images/australia_snowyhydro3.jpg\" class=\"align-center\" width=\"300\" alt=\"australia_snowyhydro3.jpg\" />\\n<figcaption>Map 1.3 - NDSI output</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\"../images/australia_snowyhydro4.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" width=\"300\" alt=\"australia_snowyhydro4.jpg\" />\\n<figcaption>Map 1.4 - Recoded \"Snow\" vs \"Non snow\"</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nThe NDSI output is created with some very simple band map by using the GRASS module \\\\\"r.mapcalculator\\\\\". Once the NDSI grid was available the NDSI threshold of 0.4 needed to be applied and this would result in a boolean grid depicting \\\\\"Snow\\\\\" and \\\\\"Non snow\\\\\" areas. To get that classification another GRASS module \\\\\"r.recode\\\\\" was used and produced the result shown above in Map 1.4 Recoded \\'Snow\\' vs \\'Non Snow\\'.\\n\\nThe recoded grid was then converted to a vector polygon dataset and the snow covered areas were extracted (shown below, Map 1.5 - Extracted snow). The snow covered areas were then clipped to the Snowy Water Catchment (shown below, Map - 1.6 Snow inside the SWC), then the large water bodies are masked out (shown below, Map 1.7 - Final snow covered area), and finally the area statistics for the snow covered area is generated.\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\"../images/australia_snowyhydro5.jpg\" class=\"align-left\" width=\"300\" alt=\"australia_snowyhydro5.jpg\" />\\n<figcaption>Map 1.5 - Extracted Snow</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n<figure>\\n<img src=\"../images/australia_snowyhy',\n",

To complete this task, we created scripts that performs this operation storing results in local SpatiaLite database. The data needed to be exportable to spreadsheet, so we used free software library to fulfil this requirement.\\n\\n## How users used tool to create FTTH/GPON network plan\\n\\nThe user started work by opening a new work context and specifying an input layer of address points to be analysed. Using the standard QGIS interface, the user could establish a set of demands on address points and finally provide the parameters necessary for further steps of the algorithm.\\n\\n![](../images/poland_ffth/step1_inputlayer.png)\\n\\nWithout having information about the existing civil infrastructure, a properly filtered OpenStreet road network were used as a routing layer.

Until now, loading (and tessellation) would freeze the GUI completely - this could take many seconds depending on the complexity of input data.\\n\\nThe basic vector layer renderer and rule-based renderer were converted to use QgsChunkedEntity which is already used for terrain rendering. There are two more improvements in addition to unlocking of GUI:\\n\\n-   loading process is multi-threaded instead of using just a single core\\n-   loading is done in tiles - so it is possible to see the tiles with 3D data appearing while other data are still being loaded\\n\\nThere is a new configuration option in the 3D tab of vector layers - it determines how deep the quadtree will be. For example, one zoom level means there will be a single tile for the whole layer. Three zoom levels means there will be 16 tiles at the leaf level (every extra zoom level multiplies that by 4, so I have limited GUI to max. 8 levels which gives \\\\~16K tiles which is already a lot).\\n\\nHow a vector layer\\\\'s tiling quadtree gets p\",\n",
